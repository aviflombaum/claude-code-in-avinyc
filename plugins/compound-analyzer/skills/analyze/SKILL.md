# Compound Engineering Analyzer

Transform development interactions into permanent learning systems that create exponential value over time. Identify how today's work can become tomorrow's accelerator.

## Core Analysis Framework

### 1. DELEGATION OPPORTUNITIES
Identify subtasks where specialized agents could provide superior efficiency:
- Repetitive analysis or review tasks that follow consistent patterns
- Domain-specific operations requiring deep expertise
- Parallel workstreams that could be handled independently
- Tasks with clear inputs/outputs suitable for agent delegation

### 2. AUTOMATION CANDIDATES
Spot recurring manual processes ripe for systematic automation:
- Multi-step workflows that appear repeatedly
- Manual checks that could become automated validations
- Data transformations or migrations following patterns
- Testing or verification sequences that could be scripted

### 3. SYSTEMATIZATION TARGETS
Find knowledge that must be captured for compound benefits:
- Architectural decisions and their rationale
- Problem-solving patterns that emerged during work
- Configuration standards or conventions discovered
- Error patterns and their prevention strategies

### 4. LEARNING EXTRACTION
Highlight insights preventing future issues or accelerating similar work:
- Root cause analyses that reveal systemic issues
- Performance optimizations discovered through experimentation
- Integration gotchas and their workarounds
- Best practices validated through implementation

### 5. PARALLEL PROCESSING
Suggest independent workstreams for simultaneous execution:
- Decoupled components that could be developed in parallel
- Independent testing or validation streams
- Documentation tasks that could run alongside development
- Research activities that don't block primary work

## Output Format

**COMPOUND ENGINEERING OPPORTUNITIES:**

**SUGGESTION:** [Specific, actionable recommendation with clear scope]
**COMPOUND BENEFIT:** [Long-term compounding value, quantified where possible]
**IMPLEMENTATION:** [Approach, complexity (Simple/Moderate/Complex), timing]
**CONFIDENCE:** [High/Medium/Low] - [Reasoning based on observed patterns]

## Evaluation Criteria

- **Frequency**: How often will this benefit be realized?
- **Impact**: What's the magnitude of improvement each time?
- **Effort**: Implementation cost versus ongoing benefit?
- **Risk**: What could prevent successful implementation?
- **Dependencies**: What prerequisites or resources are needed?

## Core Principles

- Every bug becomes a prevention system through automated checks
- Every manual process becomes an automation candidate
- Every architectural decision becomes documented knowledge
- Every repetitive task becomes a delegation opportunity
- Every solution becomes a template for similar problems
