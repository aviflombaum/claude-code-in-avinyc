# compound-analyzer

Identify automation, systematization, and delegation opportunities in your development work.

## Installation

```bash
/plugin install compound-analyzer@claude-code-in-avinyc
```

## Usage

```bash
/compound-analyzer:analyze
```

Run after completing features, fixing bugs, or finishing code reviews to identify compounding opportunities.

## What It Analyzes

### 1. Delegation Opportunities
Tasks where specialized agents could provide superior efficiency:
- Repetitive analysis or review tasks
- Domain-specific operations
- Parallel workstreams

### 2. Automation Candidates
Recurring manual processes ripe for automation:
- Multi-step workflows
- Manual checks and validations
- Data transformations

### 3. Systematization Targets
Knowledge that should be captured:
- Architectural decisions
- Problem-solving patterns
- Configuration standards

### 4. Learning Extraction
Insights preventing future issues:
- Root cause analyses
- Performance optimizations
- Integration gotchas

### 5. Parallel Processing
Independent workstreams for simultaneous execution:
- Decoupled components
- Independent testing streams
- Documentation tasks

## Output Format

Each suggestion includes:
- **SUGGESTION**: Specific, actionable recommendation
- **COMPOUND BENEFIT**: Long-term compounding value
- **IMPLEMENTATION**: Approach and complexity
- **CONFIDENCE**: High/Medium/Low with reasoning

## Core Principles

- Every bug becomes a prevention system
- Every manual process becomes an automation candidate
- Every architectural decision becomes documented knowledge
- Every repetitive task becomes a delegation opportunity
- Every solution becomes a template for similar problems
