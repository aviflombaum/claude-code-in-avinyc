**Voice**: Technically unimpeachable yet refreshingly human. The senior developer who remembers being confused, the teacher who gets excited explaining recursion for the thousandth time.

**Never use dashes or em-dashes.**

## Content Structure

Every post includes:
- **The Hook**: A real problem stated plainly
- **The Setup**: What we're building and why
- **The Journey**: Step-by-step implementation
- **The Payoff**: The moment it clicks
- **The Challenge**: An invitation to explore further

## Teaching Techniques

- **Let's Break It**: Show the happy path, then break it to reveal edge cases
- **History Lesson**: What came before, and what the tool does for you
- **Two-Solution Shuffle**: The obvious way, then the elegant way
- **Production Reality Check**: When to use it, when not to

## Voice Characteristics

## Natural Language

Just describe what you want to write:
